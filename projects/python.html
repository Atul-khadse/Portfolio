                    <li>free simple site templates
                        Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high level and interpreted programming language. It
                        supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications. It is simple and easy to
                        learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.
                    </li>
                    <li>Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language which makes it attractive
                        for Application Development.
                        Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature, makes it an ideal language for
                        scripting and rapid application development.
                    </li>
                    <li>Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object oriented, imperative and
                        functional or procedural programming styles.
                    </li>
                    <li>Python is not intended to work on special area such as web programming. That is why it is known
                        as multipurpose because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can
                        write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Python makes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in
                        python development and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Python 2 vs. Python 3
                </h4>
                <p>In most of the programming languages, whenever a new version releases, it supports the features and
                    syntax of the existing version of the language, therefore, it is easier for the projects to switch
                    in the newer version. However, in the case of Python, the two versions Python 2 and Python 3 are
                    very much different from each other.
                </p>
                <h5> A list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are given below:
                </h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>In Python 2 uses print as a statement and used as print "something" to print some string on the
                        console. On the other hand, Python 3 uses print as a function and used as print("something") to
                        print something on the console.
                    </li>
                    <li>Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's input. It returns the string
                        representing the value, which is typed by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to
                        use the int() function in Python. On the other hand, Python 3 uses input() function which
                        automatically interpreted the type of input entered by the user. However, we can cast this value
                        to any type by using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.).
                    </li>
                    <li>In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type
                        is Unicode
                    </li>
                    <li>Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2. The xrange() is the variant of
                        range() function which returns a xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range()
                        returns a list for example the function range(0,3) contains 0, 1, 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is also a small change made in Exception handling in Python 3. It defines a keyword as
                        which is necessary to be used. We will discuss it in Exception handling section of Python
                        programming</li>

                    1.Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.

                    2
                    The implementation of Python was started in the December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in
                    Netherland.

                    3
                    In February 1991, van Rossum published the code (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.

                    4
                    In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like: lambda, map, filter, and reduce.

                    5
                    Python 2.0 added new features like: list comprehensions, garbage collection system.

                    6
                    On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was designed to rectify
                    fundamental flaw of the language.

                    7
                    ABC programming language is said to be the predecessor of Python language which was capable of
                    Exception Handling and interfacing with Amoeba Operating System.

                    8
                    Python is influenced by following programming languages: (1) ABC language. (2) Modula-3.</p>

        <section id="Hello World">
            <h2>Hello World</h2>
            <article>
                <p>Python is easy to learn and code and can be execute with python interpreter. We can also use Python
                    interactive shell to test python code immediately. A simple hello world example is given below.
                    Write below code in a file and save with .py extension. Python source file has .pyextension.
                </p>
                <h4>Writing the “Hello, World!” Program
                </h4>
                <p>To write the “Hello, World!” program, let’s open up a command-line text editor such as nano and
                    create a new file: hello.py

                </p>
                <p>Once the text file opens up in the terminal window we’ll type out our program :
                </p>
                <code>
                    print("Hello, World!")
                    </code>
                <h4>Let’s break down the different components of the code.
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>print() is a function that tells the computer to perform an action. We know it is a function
                        because it uses parentheses. print() tells Python to display or output whatever we put in the
                        parentheses. By default, this will output to the current terminal window.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some functions, like the print() function, are built-in functions included in Python by default.
                        These built-in functions are always available for us to use in programs that we create. We can
                        also define our own functions that we construct ourselves through other elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Inside the parentheses of the print() function is a sequence of characters — Hello, World! —
                        that is enclosed in quotation marks. Any characters that are inside of quotation marks are
                        called a string.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once we are done writing our program, save the file and we can exit notepad.
                    </li>

                </ol>
                <h6>Once you exit out of notpad you’ll return to your shell or cmd. </h6>
                <h4>Running the “Hello, World!” Program
                </h4>
                <p>The hello.py program that you just created will cause your terminal to produce the following output:
                </p>
                <code>Hello, World!
                </code>
                <p>Congratulations! You have written the “Hello, World!” program in Python 3 .
                    Since the program ran, you can now confirm that Python 3 is properly installed and that the program is syntactically correct.</p>
